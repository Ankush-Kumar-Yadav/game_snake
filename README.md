# game_snake
This Python script implements the classic Snake Game with a graphical user interface using Tkinter. The game features a snake that moves in different directions, aiming to eat red food items and accumulate points. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. Users can restart the game with a "Restart Game" button.
